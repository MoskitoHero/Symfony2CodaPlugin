#Symfony2 Coda Plugin
This is  a basic Coda plugin to ease the most common tasks when developing with [Symfony2](http://www.symfony.com) on Panic's [Coda](http://www.panic.com/coda/) app.

It is still pretty much bare, and many functionalities need to be added. Feel free to help, fork, etc.

It has been tested on Coda 1.7.4

##Installation Instructions
Download the zip file.  
Unzip.  
Double-click the Symfony2CodaPlugin.codaplugin bundle, or drag and drop on Coda's icon.
Use it!

##Usage
This plugin requires you to have a Coda Site set up and opened.
It obviously requires you to have set up Symfony2 at the root of that Site.
